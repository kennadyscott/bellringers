/* Bellringers — the library.

   Each deck is one format plus a themed bank of prompts. "Next" cycles the bank,
   which is why ~20 decks produce essentially endless Bellringers.

   Deck fields:
     id, format (key in FORMATS), title, subtitle
     minutes      2 | 5 | 10 | 15   (how long one round realistically takes)
     grades       subset of k2 | 35 | 68
     subjects     subset of math | ela | science | social | sel   ([] = works anywhere)
     energy       low | medium | high
     group        whole | pairs | solo
     situations   which homepage tiles this shows up under
     featured     shows on the homepage carousel
     hero         this deck carries the FORMAT's slide art (one per format)
     art          this deck's own edition slide; overrides the format art
     direction    overrides the format's direction line (K-2 editions reword it)
     prompts      shape depends on FORMATS[format].render
